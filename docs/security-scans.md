# Security Scans

## Overview

This document explains how security scans are configured in the project and how to interpret the results. The security scans are performed using `npm audit` and Snyk to identify vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.

## Configuration

### GitHub Workflow

A GitHub workflow file named `security-scans.yml` has been added to the repository. This workflow is configured to run daily and on every push to the main branch. It performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the code.
2. Sets up Node.js.
3. Installs dependencies.
4. Runs `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities.
5. Runs Snyk to check for vulnerabilities.
6. Uploads the results of `npm audit` and Snyk if any vulnerabilities are found.

### package.json

The `package.json` file has been updated to include `npm audit` and Snyk as development dependencies. Additionally, a script named `security-scans` has been added to run both `npm audit` and Snyk.

## Interpreting the Results

### npm audit

`npm audit` checks for known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. The results are displayed in the console output. If any vulnerabilities are found, they will be listed along with their severity and a recommendation for how to fix them.

### Snyk

Snyk performs a similar function to `npm audit` but provides additional features such as monitoring for new vulnerabilities and providing detailed remediation advice. The results of the Snyk scan are also displayed in the console output. If any vulnerabilities are found, they will be listed along with their severity and a recommendation for how to fix them.

## Conclusion

Regular security scans are essential to maintaining the security of the project. By using `npm audit` and Snyk, we can identify and address vulnerabilities in our dependencies, ensuring that our project remains secure.
